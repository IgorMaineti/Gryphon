# Adding manual translations

The last step in developing our Model is adding the ability to shuffle the deck. We'll do that by adding the method below to the `Model` class:

```` swift
    func shuffleDeck() {
        guard !deck.isEmpty else {
            return
        }

        let currentDeck = self.deck
        let n = currentDeck.count
        for i in 1..<n {
            let index = n - i
            let random = Int.random(in: 0...index)
            let temp = deck[index]
            deck[index] = deck [random]
            deck[random] = temp
        }
    }
````

Switch to the Gryphon target and translate the model with **⌘+B**. Gryphon will raise a warning:

![Warning: Reference to standard library "random(in:)" was not translated.](assets/images/iOS/ios10.png)

This happens because Gryphon doesn't yet support the `random` methods from the Swift standard library.

This statement could be translated to Kotlin as `(0..index).random()`; we can teach Gryphon to do that in two ways:

#### Method 1: Translation comments

Remember the `// gryphon insert:` comment we added to the beginning of the file a few steps ago? That's an example of a *translation comment* - a special kind of comment that can be used to insert code, remove it, change it, etc. We can use a similar translation comment, `// gryphon value:`, to manually specify the value we want to use for the `random` variable:

```` swift
let random = /* gryphon value: (0..10).random() */ Int.random(in: 0...index)
````

If you try translating this code again (**⌘+B** on the Gryphon target), you'll see the warning's now gone and the Android app builds and runs successfully.

You can learn more about this and other translation comments in the [documentation](translationComments.html).

#### Method 2: Templates

Translation comments work well for dealing with unsupported methods that appear occasionally. If a method shows up too often, however, it might be better to use the more general solution of creating a *template*. Let's do that now for the `random` method above as a quick example - for more details, check out the [templates documentation](templates.html).

Start by declaring a new function called `gryphonTemplates` at the beginning of the `Model.swift` file:

```` swift
private func gryphonTemplates() {
    // Supporting variables
    let index: Int = 0

    // Template:
    Int.random(in: 0...index)
    // Translation:
    "(0..index).random()"
}
````

Here's what this function does:
- First, it declares an auxiliary `index` variable that we'll need to define our template.
- Then, it defines the template itself, which is the expression we want to translate - in this case, the `Int.random(in: 0...index)` expression. Every time Gryphon finds this expression in the code, it'll look up our translation and use it.
- Finally, it states the translation to be used, as a literal string.

This definition already works - if you remove the `gryphon value` comment from before, everything should translate and compile correctly. However, templates really shine when they can be used for different cases - this one will only work if we want a random number from `0` to `index`, since that's what we wrote. We can change that by replacing these hard coded values with variables that start with `_`, which act as placeholders. Gryphon knows it can match these variables to any expression of the same type.

Replace the `gryphonTemplates` function with the one below:

```` swift
private func gryphonTemplates() {
    // Supporting variables
    let _startNumber: Int = 0
    let _endNumber: Int = 0

    // Template:
    Int.random(in: _startNumber..._endNumber)
    // Translation:
    "(_startNumber.._endNumber).random()"
}
````

This template will work for any expression of the form `Int.random(in: _startNumber..._endNumber)`, no matter what values are used for `_startNumber` and `_endNumber` - so long as they're both `Int`s. In particular, it will still match our `Int.random(in: 0...index)` expression, since both `0` and `index` are `Int`s.

The only remaining issue is that Swift is raising warnings for unused expressions. We can silence them with an empty assignment to `_`:

```` swift
// Template:
_ = Int.random(in: _startNumber..._endNumber)
// Translation:
_ = "(_startNumber.._endNumber).random()"
````

You should now be able to build the iOS app (**⌘+B** on the MyAwesomeiOSApp target), translate the code (**⌘+B** on the Gryphon target), and build the Android app (**⌘+B** on the Kotlin target), and everything should be working fine.
